Inventory Manager is a simple database managing program written in C.

## Compile
goods: $ make

## Test
$ ./goods testdb<br />
<b>OR</b><br />
$ ./goods

## Notes
Global variables: it would take too much time to nestle them in anywhere since I was done with most of the code when I actually learned about how to share local vars.

The reusing of code could be a lot better if I didn't decide to work alone (I think). This task was very time consuming, and in the end, I decided to "get it done" rather than making it streamlined.

Adding external database file support was a hasty decision made too early in the actual coding of this task, and if I were to do it again, it would definitly be an implementation i'd do at the very end.
